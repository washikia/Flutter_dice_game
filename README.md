# flutter_dice_game
simple flutter app for playing dice
this is one the first flutter apps that i created while doing Angela Yu's flutter course. Here I used a stateful widget so that I can change the image of the dice as the user taps on the scree. Also, I used extended widget to fill the widget to the screen. TextButton widget was used for the two dice (TextButton is the new name for FlatButton). It has a mandatory on_pressed parameter. I use a setState function to change the state. These has to be inside the build function of the stateful widget to be able to do hot reload.
